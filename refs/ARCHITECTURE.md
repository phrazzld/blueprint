# ARCHITECTURE GUIDELINES

This document outlines default architectural standards and preferences. Follow these guidelines unless explicitly overridden by project-specific requirements.

## 🐳 Dockerization
- **Default Approach:** Dockerize all applications by default.
- **Expectations:**
  - Include a clear and efficient `Dockerfile` at the project root.
  - Provide a `docker-compose.yml` file defining all necessary services, dependencies, and configurations for local development.
  - Ensure the Docker environment closely mirrors production to maintain consistency.

## 🚦 Local Environment Execution
- **Default Command:** Provide a straightforward, consistent command to launch the local development environment (e.g., `docker-compose up`).
- **Logging:**
  - Configure containers to emit structured logs (JSON) by default.
  - Logs must be accessible via standard Docker logging commands (`docker logs <container_name>`).
  - Ensure logs include timestamps, log levels, service names, correlation IDs, and sufficient context for debugging.

## 📡 APIs & Service Communication
- **API Design:**
  - Explicitly define RESTful APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger.
  - Maintain clear API contracts, documenting request/response structures and status codes explicitly.
- **Inter-Service Communication:**
  - Default to REST over HTTP(S), favoring simplicity and explicitness.
  - Consider gRPC or message queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ) only if explicitly justified by the project requirements.

## 📊 Analytics
- **Default Analytics Provider:** Google Analytics.

## ⚙️ Error Handling & Resilience
- **Explicit Error Handling:** Clearly handle and log errors with actionable, structured messages.
- **Resilience Patterns:**
  - Implement retries, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation where appropriate.
  - Avoid single points of failure—design services to scale horizontally.

## 🛠️ Environment Variables & Configuration
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Use `.env` files for local development.
  - Ensure production configurations use secure environment variable injection (no secrets in code).
  - Explicitly document required environment variables in the `README.md` or `CONFIG.md`.

## 🧩 Feature Flags
- Utilize feature flags judiciously for experimental or incremental feature rollouts.
- Default to simple environment-based flags or adopt a dedicated feature-flagging service if complexity warrants it (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Flagsmith).

## 🗃️ Data & Storage
- Clearly define persistent data storage services in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis).
- Implement regular automated backups and data restoration procedures.
