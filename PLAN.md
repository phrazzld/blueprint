# BLUEPRINT - PLAN.md

This document provides a comprehensive specification for blueprint -- a CLI-driven scaffolding tool designed to initialize software projects efficiently and consistently using templates, interactive prompts, and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Project Overview

The tool simplifies the setup of software projects by generating standardized reference files and customized project scaffolding. It gathers user input interactively and leverages LLMs to generate tailored documentation and configuration files.

## Goals
- Provide a streamlined, interactive CLI experience.
- Automate project setup for consistency and efficiency.
- Leverage LLMs to dynamically generate detailed documentation and files.
- Facilitate easy project initialization aligned with predefined best practices.
- Allow flexible customization while providing sensible defaults.

## Features

### Interactive CLI
- Prompt the user step-by-step for project details:
  - Project Name
  - Brief Project Description
  - Technology Stack (e.g., Node.js, Go, Python)
  - Dockerization preference (default: yes)
  - Analytics integration (default: Google Analytics)
  - Preferred Testing Frameworks (default: Jest, Cypress)
  - Feature flags requirement (default: yes)

### Template-Based Project Scaffolding
- Generate predefined markdown reference files:
  - `README.md` (initial blank or minimal)
  - `PLAN.md` (customized via LLM)
  - `DEVREF.md` (default, best practices)
  - `AESTHETIC.md` (customized via LLM)
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` (customized defaults)
  - `CHECKLIST.md` (default with sensible defaults)
  - `CLAUDE.md` (directive for AI assistant)
- Directory structure automatically generated based on chosen tech stack.
- Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml generated and configured.

### LLM Integration
- Dynamically generate detailed, tailored project documentation:
  - Clearly articulated project plan (`PLAN.md`)
  - Customized aesthetic guidelines (`AESTHETIC.md`)
  - Context-aware architecture defaults (`ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- Prompt LLM with structured context for precise outputs.

### Extensible and Maintainable
- Modular architecture for easy addition of future features (payments, splash pages, advanced analytics).
- Clearly organized templates directory to facilitate easy maintenance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### CLI Functionality
- CLI installs and runs seamlessly on common operating systems (Mac, Linux).
- User prompted interactively with clear questions and helpful default selections.
- Clearly communicates progress and outputs informative logs and error messages.

### Project Generation
- Project directory created with correctly named files and directories.
- Default and custom user inputs accurately reflected in generated files.
- Generated markdown files meet documentation and clarity standards.
- Docker setup correctly initializes and runs the application locally.

### LLM-driven Customization
- LLM reliably produces accurate, context-sensitive content.
- Outputs explicitly verified against provided user inputs and defaults.

### Documentation & Code Quality
- All generated files strictly adhere to documented best practices (see `DEVREF.md`).
- Linting, testing, and Docker setup pass without issues.

### Testing
- Automated tests cover:
  - CLI interaction logic
  - File generation correctness
  - Docker environment setup and functionality
