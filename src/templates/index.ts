- **Think hard** and thoroughly review the provided \`PLAN.md\`.
- Explicitly identify:
  - Core features clearly stated.
  - Dependencies explicitly defined or implied.
  - Acceptance criteria clearly documented.
  - Any implicit requirements or assumptions needing clarification.

## 2. Structure the TODO.md
- Create or update \`TODO.md\` explicitly in this structured format:

\`\`\`markdown
# TODO

## [Feature/Section Name from PLAN.md]

- [ ] Task title (atomic and clear)
  - Explicit Description: Concise, actionable details.
  - Dependencies: Clearly stated (tasks or external requirements).
  - Priority: Explicitly defined (high, medium, low).

Repeat explicitly for each distinct task.
\`\`\`

- Ensure every task is explicitly atomic (each can be implemented, tested, and verified independently).

## 2. Explicitly Prioritize Tasks
- Think carefully about the optimal sequence:
  - Clearly order tasks by priority (high-priority tasks first).
  - Explicitly highlight and resolve dependencies clearly within task ordering.

## 3. Clarify and Document
- If uncertainty or ambiguity arises during task decomposition, explicitly note this clearly and request clarification.
- Document all assumptions explicitly made during ticketing clearly at the top of \`TODO.md\`.

## 4. Verify and Summarize
- Explicitly cross-reference each task with \`PLAN.md\` to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- Clearly summarize the total number of tasks and their priority distribution at the bottom of \`TODO.md\`.

## Example of Ticketed Task

\`\`\`markdown
- [ ] Implement user authentication
  - Explicit Description: Implement Google OAuth login flow, including login and logout functionality, aligned with security standards in DEVREF.md.
  - Dependencies: None
  - Priority: High
\`\`\`

Explicitly follow this structured, reasoning-intensive process to ensure tasks are clearly defined, atomic, and actionable.`;

/**

 */
const CLEAR_TODOS_CONTENT = `Carefully read the TODO.md file and explicitly select the next highest-priority incomplete item. Clearly document the reason for your choice (priority, dependencies, risk, etc.).

Before implementing, explicitly create a structured implementation plan:
- Clearly summarize exactly what needs to be done.
- Explicitly outline your intended approach, considering:
  - Dependencies on other tasks or systems.
  - Side-effects and risks clearly identified.
  - Explicit references to relevant standards from DEVREF.md, AESTHETIC.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CHECKLIST.md.

Think hard about the optimal implementation strategy and explicitly document your reasoning clearly in this implementation plan.

Then fully implement the solution exactly according to your plan:
- Explicitly adhere to all guidelines provided in DEVREF.md, AESTHETIC.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CHECKLIST.md.
- Immediately verify all relevant builds, linting, and tests explicitly. Clearly document results.
- If verification fails, explicitly troubleshoot, clearly document your debugging steps, fix the issue, and verify again.

Upon successful verification:
- Explicitly mark the task as completed in TODO.md.
- Clearly document your commit message, explicitly summarizing the task and your chosen implementation strategy.

Repeat this structured process iteratively until no incomplete tasks remain in TODO.md.

If at any point uncertainty arises, explicitly pause and request clarification immediately.`;

 * Claude command template for fix-the-bug.md
 */
const FIX_THE_BUG_CONTENT = `A bug report has been provided in BUG.md. Carefully perform the following steps explicitly:

1. **Triage and Hypothesis Formation**
   - **Think carefully** as you reproduce and verify the bug:
     - Explicitly document the Reproduction Steps.
     - Clearly state Expected vs. Actual behavior.
     - Identify and explicitly document the most likely components or code paths involved.
   - **Think hard** to form initial hypotheses about potential causes.
   - Explicitly note if user error seems highly probable, clearly explaining your reasoning.

2. **Structured Debugging**
   - **Thoughtfully choose** your most promising debugging steps (isolating variables, adding logs, unit tests, bisecting recent changes).
   - Explicitly document each debugging attempt clearly and chronologically:
     - **Think carefully** about each step before you perform it.
     - Explicitly state exactly what was tried, the precise outcome, and **carefully reason** about what each outcome reveals about the bug.
     - **Reflect thoroughly** on each outcome, updating your hypotheses explicitly based on new insights gained.

3. **Iterative Debugging Loop**
   - Continue explicitly iterating this debugging approach until the bug is definitively fixed:
     - **Think hard** about each new insight to refine your understanding further.
     - Confirm explicitly and clearly document when your fix resolves the issue.
     - Clearly summarize exactly what code or configuration change resolved the bug.

4. **Postmortem and Reflection**
   - After fixing the bug, **thoughtfully produce** a concise, structured postmortem that clearly includes:
     - Root cause explicitly summarized.
     - Timeline of debugging steps explicitly documented.
     - Clearly stated final resolution.
     - Explicit and thoughtful recommendations to prevent recurrence.
   - **Think carefully** as you commit all changes, explicitly documenting the resolution and referencing the postmortem.

Follow this explicitly structured process, thoughtfully leveraging deep reasoning at each step. Explicitly request clarification whenever uncertainty arises.`;

/**
 * Default template for DEVREF.md

const DEVREF_CONTENT = `# Software Engineering Best Practices for Claude

Use this document as explicit guidelines for maintaining consistently robust, readable, and secure software. Reference regularly when committing code, writing tests, or designing features.

## Commits
- **Conventional Commits**: Strictly follow conventional commit formats:
  - \`feat:\` New feature
  - \`fix:\` Bug fix
  - \`docs:\` Documentation updates
  - \`refactor:\` Refactoring without functional changes
  - \`test:\` Adding or modifying tests
  - \`chore:\` Maintenance or tooling changes
- **Atomic Commits**: Every commit must encapsulate exactly one logical, clearly defined change.

## Logging & Observability
- Implement structured logging in JSON format consistently across environments.
- Always include useful context in logs (timestamps, user IDs, error types).
- Incorporate correlation IDs for tracing requests through distributed systems.
- Instrument clear metrics for monitoring user and system performance.

## Testing
- Maintain high test coverage:
  - Unit tests: Test individual functions/methods thoroughly.
  - Integration tests: Verify interactions between components/services.
  - End-to-End (E2E) tests: Validate full system workflows from user perspective.
- Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) strictly unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- Ensure tests are fast, repeatable, and deterministic.
- Confirm all tests pass before commits and merges.

## Documentation
- Explicitly document critical architecture and design decisions within the codebase (markdown).
- Clearly document API endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger.
- Include concise, practical setup instructions for local development.
- Keep documentation current; update immediately following code changes.

## Architecture & Design
- Clearly separate infrastructure, business logic, and interface layers (Hexagonal Architecture).
- Always define explicit API contracts.
- Implement modular, loosely coupled components that are easy to maintain.
- Handle all errors explicitly, providing clear and actionable error messages.
- Design resilient systems: use retries, graceful degradation, and circuit breakers when appropriate.

## Iterative Development
- Commit small, incremental, deployable changes frequently.
- Ensure each incremental change is fully tested and stable before progressing.
- Prioritize quick feedback and incremental validation of assumptions.

## Automation & CI/CD
- Ensure build, test, deployment, and database migration processes are fully automated and reproducible.
- Maintain robust CI/CD pipelinesâ€”never commit code that breaks these pipelines.
- Standardize and containerize development environments (Docker).
- Explicitly manage infrastructure through Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).

## Security Practices
- Always assume inputs are untrusted; rigorously validate and sanitize.
- Regularly update dependencies and explicitly address vulnerabilities identified by security scans.
- Adhere strictly to least-privilege access principles.
- Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest.

## Performance & Scalability
- Regularly verify performance benchmarks and optimize where necessary.
- Monitor and explicitly log performance metrics.
- Design for resilience, implement retries, rate limiting, caching, and avoid single points of failure.
- Include stress and load testing regularly in the development cycle.

## Handling Technical Debt
- Identify and explicitly tag technical debt in comments (\`// TECH DEBT:\`).
- Prioritize reducing technical debt incrementally alongside feature development.

---

Always strictly adhere to this reference guide to ensure code consistency, maintainability, and quality. Explicitly reference this document when making decisions about implementation details, testing strategies, logging, or architecture. If uncertainty arises, request clarification rather than assuming or deviating from these standards.

4. Bug Prioritization Guidelines
5. Bug Resolution Process
6. Testing & Verification Process
7. Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Craft a clear, compelling VISION.md document that captures the product's essence and direction. This document will anchor all future product planning and development.

Focus on these key elements:

1. Product Essence
   - Clearly articulate the core product purpose and the central user problem it solves.
   - Highlight the ideal user and how the product enhances their experience or addresses their needs.

2. Benefits and Value
   - Emphasize transformative user benefits and experiences rather than features or technical specifics.
   - Identify the product's unique value propositionâ€”why it's different and better than alternatives.

3. User Experience
   - Describe the overall user experience you aim to deliver, prioritizing simplicity, intuitiveness, and delight.
   - Connect UX explicitly to user outcomes and the core product value.

4. Success
   - Define clear, focused success metrics tied directly to user satisfaction and impact.

Keep the vision concise, inspiring, and focused on clarity, user benefits, and product impact.
